Run Pod using definition file webapp.yaml
The application stores logs at location /log/app.log.
You can see the logs with the following command: kubectl exec webapp -- cat /log/app.log

If the POD was to get deleted now, would you be able to view these logs?
Configure a volume to store these logs at /var/log/webapp on the host.
